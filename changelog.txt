Changelog of CA Lab

V1.8.0.2 (Unreleased)

### CALab – Ultra‑Short Changelog (User‑Focused)

* Faster EPICS connections and updates (tuned CA timeouts, 
  background polling). 
* More robust, thread‑safe operation in LabVIEW; fewer hangs
  on abort/stop and during heavy parallel use. 
* Richer per‑PV results: values, status/severity, timestamps, 
  record fields, and per‑PV error information. 
* Clearer diagnostics via the `info` API and a global PV error counter
  for quick health checks.
* Improved Linux support with runtime loading of EPICS libraries,
  avoiding hard build‑time dependencies.

### CALab – Full Changelog
----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Major architectural rewrite and threading model
* The core CALab implementation (`calab.cpp`, `globals.cpp`, 
  `PVItem.cpp` and supporting headers) has been extensively refactored
  for thread-safety and maintainability while keeping the LabVIEW API 
  and data structures stable.
* Introduced a central `Globals` singleton responsible for EPICS CA
  context management, the PV registry, per‑VI instance tracking,
  background worker registration, and coordinated shutdown.
* Added generic `TimeoutUniqueLock` and `TimeoutSharedLock` RAII
  wrappers for `std::mutex` / `std::shared_timed_mutex` that enforce
  acquisition timeouts and log detailed diagnostics when locks
  cannot be obtained in time, making deadlocks and long holds
  visible in the debug log.
* Clarified and enforced a lock hierarchy, consistently using
  shared/exclusive access on the PV registry to reduce contention
  between CA callbacks, LabVIEW calls, and background workers.

---

# EPICS interaction and Linux support

* On Linux, EPICS CA and libCom are now loaded dynamically via
  `epics_dynamic_linux.cpp` and the new compatibility shim
  `epics_compat.h`. This allows building and distributing CALab
  without EPICS headers on the build host and improves robustness
  when different EPICS versions are present at runtime.
* Added fall‑back text tables and optional environment accessors so
  CALab continues to work even when certain symbols (such as
  `dbr_text` or `envGetConfigParamPtr`) are not exported by the EPICS
  libraries.
* Unified EPICS context attach/detach logic through a new RAII helper
  `CaContextGuard`, ensuring that worker threads, callbacks, and all
  public entry points operate on a valid CA context.

---

# PV registry, instance management and teardown

* Introduced a more robust per‑VI instance model (`MyInstanceData`)
  with explicit lifecycle hooks (`reserved`, `unreserved`, `aborted`).
  Each instance tracks its bound LabVIEW handles, the first function
  that used it, an `activeCalls` counter, and an `isUnreserving` flag,
  enabling controlled teardown.
* Implemented a generic array‑to‑instance map in `Globals` to resolve
  which VI instance owns a given LabVIEW array handle. `getValue`,
  `putValue` and `addEvent` now reliably bind arrays to their owning
  instance even in multi‑VI and reentrant setups.
* Added a per‑instance call guard that increments `activeCalls` on
  entry and decrements it on exit. The guard blocks new calls while
  an instance is unreserving and wakes waiters on every exit,
  allowing `unreserved` to wait for all in‑flight EPICS operations
  to finish without risking deadlocks.
* The `unreserved` callback now performs a careful two‑phase
  teardown of the `PvIndexArray`. It atomically claims `PvIndexEntry`
  objects, waits (with timeout) until all readers drop their
  references, and then deletes entries either immediately or via a
  deferred deletion worker. This eliminates use‑after‑free scenarios
  that could previously occur during shutdown.
* `Globals::unregisterArraysForInstance` now removes all
  array‑to‑instance associations under a timed write lock,
  preventing stale mappings when an instance disappears.

---

# PvIndexArray and change tracking

* Reworked `PvIndexArray` entries: each slot now points to a 
  `PvIndexEntry` object holding a `PVItem*`, a `PVMetaInfo` block, an
  internal atomic reference counter and a deletion flag. Readers use
  `try_acquire()` / `release()` to safely share entries; deleters set
  `deleting=true` and reclaim entries once `refs` drops to zero.
* `PVMetaInfo` caches the last change‑hash of its `PVItem` and exposes
  `hasChanged()` / `update()` helpers. `getValue` uses this to detect
  unchanged PVs without copying payloads, which makes large PV arrays
  much cheaper to poll.
* New helpers around `PvIndexArray` update the stored change‑hash
  either globally or only for changed indices, keeping tracking
  consistent even when only a subset of PVs is refreshed.

---

# Background worker for value changes

* CALab now decouples EPICS value‑change callbacks from PV updates by
  queuing change events into a dedicated background worker 
  (a `ValueChangeTask` deque). The worker thread looks up the
  corresponding `PVItem`, updates its cached DBR buffer, time
  metadata, status and severity, and then notifies subscribers.
* The worker uses `TimeoutSharedLock` for PV registry lookups and
  `TimeoutUniqueLock` on the per‑PV mutex; failures to acquire locks
  within bounded time produce clear debug messages instead of blocking
  indefinitely.
* When `.RTYP` PVs update, the worker automatically propagates the
  record type to the parent base PV. For other field PVs 
  (`BASE.FIELD`), the latest field value is cached as a string on the
  parent `PVItem`, with careful numeric‑to‑string conversion when the
  field is numeric.
* After processing each task, the worker notifies interested LabVIEW
  subscribers via `postEventForPv`, which snapshots subscribers,
  fills their `sResult` clusters from the current `PVItem` state,
  and posts user events outside of internal locks.

---

# LabVIEW user event handling

* Introduced an explicit `EventRegistry` that maps PV names to 
  `(LVUserEventRef, sResult*)` pairs. `addEvent` ensures that the
  target `PVItem` exists in the PV registry, registers the event, and
  optionally posts an event immediately if the PV already has a value.
* `destroyEvent` now walks the entire event registry and removes every
  occurrence of the given `LVUserEventRef`, deleting empty PV entries.
  This avoids dangling references and keeps the registry compact.
* `postEventForPv` snapshots subscribers while holding the registry’s
  event mutex and posts LabVIEW events without that lock held,
  preventing reentrancy problems and potential deadlocks with user code.

---

# Numeric formatting and PREC handling

* The `PVItem::FormatUnit` numeric formatting logic has been
  completely rewritten. It now fully respects the `PREC` field for all
  numeric record types, switching to scientific notation when a value
  is too small to be represented reasonably in fixed notation at the
  requested precision.
* Formatting is locale‑aware: decimal and thousands separators are
  chosen based on the current C++ locale of the calling thread. For
  integer‑like values with `PREC=0`, thousands separators are inserted
  while preserving the sign.
* When no `PREC` is available, CALab uses heuristics to avoid
  floating‑point artefacts: it finds a small number of decimal places
  that round the value cleanly within a tolerance, trims trailing
  zeros, removes a trailing decimal point if necessary, and switches
  to scientific notation for very large or very small values.

---

# getValue / putValue behaviour and error reporting

* `getValue` has been restructured into clear phases: instance
  resolution and binding, call‑guard activation, PV registry/field
  initialization, subscription and connection handling, 
  change detection, and output population. This makes the control flow
  more predictable and ensures concurrent calls coordinate correctly
  via per‑instance `activeCalls`.
* When only a subset of PVs has changed, CALab now incrementally
  cleans and repopulates only the affected entries in `ResultArray`,
  `FirstStringValue`, `FirstDoubleValue`, and `DoubleValueArray`.
  This significantly reduces LabVIEW heap churn for large PV arrays.
* Memory cleanup has been centralised in `CleanupResult` and
  `cleanupMemory`, which now support both full teardown and selective
  cleanup based on a list of changed indices. Any errors from the
  LabVIEW memory manager are logged with timestamps and error codes.
* `fillResultFromPv` always pulls the current error state from `PVItem`
  into the `ErrorIO` cluster and skips updating the error string when
  the code and string are unchanged, avoiding unnecessary allocations
  during steady‑state operation.
* `putValue` has been refactored around a `PutValueCtx` helper that
  handles string, double and 64‑bit integer sources
  (`StringValueArray2D`, `DoubleValueArray2D`, `LongValueArray2D`).
  It performs robust type checking, clamps values to EPICS native
  ranges where needed, and records per‑PV error messages on conversion
  failures.
* When `wait4readback` is true, CALab uses `ca_put_callback` and a
  small `PutCtx` object to track callback completions, waiting up to
  the specified timeout while interleaving `ca_pend_event()` calls
  with internal notifications. If any callbacks time out, the
  communication status is set accordingly.

---

# disconnectPVs and communication status

* `disconnectPVs` has been rewritten to minimise the time spent
  holding the PV registry lock. It first collects the `PVItem` objects
  to disconnect (either all PVs or a deduplicated, parent‑aware subset
  of the requested names) under a shared lock, then releases the lock
  and performs channel clear / connection teardown work outside the
  critical section.
* When called with `All=true`, `disconnectPVs` now first checks
  whether more than one VI instance currently has active CALab arrays
  and refuses to disconnect in that case, preventing one VI from
  inadvertently disconnecting PVs used by others.
* The global PV error counter and per‑PV error codes now feed into
  `CommunicationStatus`: a non‑zero status is reported only when
  at least one addressed PV is currently in an error state, rather
  than treating any historic error as a permanent global failure.

---

# info() and diagnostic visibility

* `info()` has been expanded to report CALab version (including build
  type and word size), the compiled‑against EPICS base version, 
  the CA protocol version, all EPICS environment variables known via
  `env_param_list`, and CALab‑specific environment variables
  (`CALAB_POLLING`, `CALAB_NODBG`).
* New helper `populateInfoStringArray` writes this data into a 2D
  LabVIEW string array of (key, value) rows, correctly disposing and
  reallocating internal string handles when dimensions change and
  avoiding stale data when shrinking.
* `populateAllResultArray` builds a snapshot of all base PVs currently
  in the registry, sorted by PV name, and fills an `sResultArrayHdl`
  using the same logic as `fillResultFromPv`, giving `CaLabInfo.vi`
  a consistent view of all PVs, including status, severity, timestamp,
  fields and error information.

---

# Record field validation and metadata

* New methods in `Globals` (`recordFieldIsCommonField` and
  `recordFieldExists`) validate whether a field name is valid for a
  given EPICS record type, using a comprehensive hard‑coded field list
  plus a small cache. This prevents CALab from trying to connect to
  obviously non‑existent field PVs and improves behaviour when users
  request invalid fields.
* Field PV updates now populate a per‑PV field map on the parent
  `PVItem` with human‑readable string values. `getValue` uses this
  cache to fill `FieldNameArray` and `FieldValueArray` without extra
  EPICS lookups, so applications can access record fields efficiently.

---

# Miscellaneous improvements

* All public and internal headers (`calab.h`, `globals.h`, `PVItem.h`,
  `TimeoutUniqueLock.h`, `epics_compat.h`) have been thoroughly
  documented with clearer comments on ownership, threading rules and
  semantics. This documentation work does not change the binary
  interface but makes the codebase significantly easier to understand
  and maintain.
* Debug output is now centralised through `CaLabDbgPrintf` /
  `CaLabDbgPrintfD` and enriched with timestamps and contextual tags
  (function names, lock names, PV names), making diagnostics for
  timing issues and deadlocks much more straightforward.
* Many internal error paths have been hardened: all LabVIEW memory
  allocations are checked, exceptions in DLL entry points are caught
  and logged, and defensive checks prevent further work once the
  global `stopped` flag indicates that CALab is shutting down.

  # Improved polymorphic vi handling (boolean input)
  # Fixes caLabPut2x.vi (1D-name-array with 1D-value-array)
  # Keeps last valid value in error case

  - Fire and forget not longer available
   (dummy connectors for compatibility)

V1.1.1.1 (Released: January 2011)
  # Holds last valid value of PV after channel disconnection with
    current state info
  # Fixes for EPICS Base "escape-paths.patch", "errlog-atExit.patch"
    and "rsrv.patch"

---------------------------------------------------------------------
V1.1.1.0 (Released: January 2011)
  + WORKS WITH LINUX NOW!!!
  + Works with LabVIEW 7.0 up to LabVIEW 2010
  + Improved performance (much more faster Channel Access IO,
    faster reconnect)
  + Internal PV cache to improve read and write access and reduce
    network traffic
  + User defined fields of EPICS PV such as "EGU", "DESCRIPTION" etc.
  + New additional fire-and-forget-bit for speeding up write
    If you use the fire and forget mode you'll get no success info
  + User defined timeout for Channel Access communication (optional)
  + User defined buffer for reconnect and put task (optional)
  + More PV information bundled in output cluster
  + Status bit of PV for easy health check

  - In LabVIEW 8.5 and higher "initPV.vi" and "disconnectPV.vi"
    are no longer needed.
  - Reduced user-VIs to "caLabGet.vi" and "caLabPut.vi"

  # Fixes memory leak
  # Holds last valid value of PV after channel disconnection with
    current state info
  # Better error handling (no frozen LabVIEW anymore)
  # Built with EPICS Base 3.14.12
